•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

|Net sales|are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from foreign exchange rates.|
|---|---|
|Operating income|is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 2022.|
|This guidance assumes|among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.|

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

All share and per share information for comparable prior year periods throughout this release have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the 20-for-1 stock split effected on May 27, 2022.|
|First quarter 2023 net income|Includes a pre-tax valuation loss of $0.5 billion included in non-operating expense from the common stock investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc., compared to a pre-tax valuation loss of $7.6 billion from the investment in first quarter 2022.|

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information

financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on

•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

Excludes the impact of Whole Foods Market. Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

N/A Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

Excludes the impact of Whole Foods Market. Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information

|Net sales|are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from foreign exchange rates.|
|---|---|
|Operating income|is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 2022.|
|This guidance assumes|among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.|

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

N/A Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

N/A Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

non-governmental organizations and set up donation campaigns across 16 Amazon online stores globally to make it 
easy for customers to support communities impacted by these earthquakes. 
•

energy portfolio now includes 164 wind and solar farms and 237 rooftop solar projects in 22 countries, totaling over 20 
gigawatts—an amount of energy that could power 5.3 million U.S. homes. Amazon has been the largest corporate 
buyer of renewable energy for three years running.
•
Expanded the use of electric delivery vehicles from Rivian, as part of the company’s commitment to dramatically

Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of April 27, 2023, and are subject to 
substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and 
spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, 
the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below. Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

- Introduced Leadership Liftoff, an onboarding program for operations area managers. New managers enrolled in the program participate in group sessions, on-the-job training, and self-paced learning to help them gain skills and confidence to lead successful teams and foster connections between new leaders.

Supporting communities and protecting the environment Amazon believes that success and scale bring broad responsibility to help the planet, future generations, and local communities in which the company has a significant presence. Amazon employees have passion for investing in these areas, and a sampling of the efforts from this past quarter are that Amazon:

- Activated the company’s global logistics network to support communities impacted by earthquakes in Türkiye and Syria. The company turned its fulfillment center in Istanbul into a Disaster Relief Hub and partnered with local organizations to ship hundreds of thousands of relief items to affected regions. Amazon also made cash donations to non-governmental organizations and set up donation campaigns across 16 Amazon online stores globally to make it easy for customers to support communities impacted by these earthquakes.
- Set a record in 2022 for the most renewable energy purchased by a single company in one year. Amazon’s renewable energy portfolio now includes 164 wind and solar farms and 237 rooftop solar projects in 22 countries, totaling over 20 gigawatts—an amount of energy that could power 5.3 million U.S. homes. Amazon has been the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy for three years running.
- Expanded the use of electric delivery vehicles from Rivian, as part of the company’s commitment to dramatically reduce its carbon emissions. These custom vans from Rivian have now been used to deliver more than 75 million packages in 500 U.S. cities and regions. Amazon began rolling out its electric delivery vans in the summer of 2022 and now has thousands on the road.
- Announced over $22 million in low-rate loans and grants to help build affordable homes in Washington, D.C., and Capitol Heights, Maryland. Since creating the Housing Equity Fund in 2021, Amazon has committed nearly $1.6 billion to help create or preserve affordable homes across Amazon’s hometown communities.
- Announced funding for 8,000 U.S. schools to provide access to computer science education to more than 2 million students by the end of the 2022-2023 academic year through Amazon Future Engineer. By providing professional development for teachers, curriculum development, college scholarships, and internships, Amazon aims to inspire millions of students from underserved and historically underrepresented communities to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).
- Launched the Zero Emission Maritime Buyers Alliance (ZEMBA) in partnership with the Aspen Institute, Patagonia, and Tchibo. ZEMBA will work to reduce the climate impact of maritime shipping by helping to create sustainable economic models in renewable energy, zero-emission fuel production, infrastructure, and clean maritime services.
- Announced that the Right Now Climate Fund is developing the world’s first commercial-scale seaweed farm located between offshore wind turbines in the North Sea to help address climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide as it grows.

Financial Guidance The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of April 27, 2023, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below. Second Quarter 2023 Guidance

|Net sales|are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from foreign exchange rates.|
|---|---|
|Operating income|is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 2022.|
|This guidance assumes|among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.|

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

 100 % Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

|Net sales|are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from foreign exchange rates.|
|---|---|
|Operating income|is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 2022.|
|This guidance assumes|among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.|

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in

 100 % Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain

•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared

foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

Supporting communities and protecting the environment
Amazon believes that success and scale bring broad responsibility to help the planet, future generations, and local communities 
in which the company has a significant presence. Amazon employees have passion for investing in these areas, and a sampling 
of the efforts from this past quarter are that Amazon: 
•
Activated the company’s global logistics network to support communities impacted by earthquakes in Türkiye and 
Syria. The company turned its fulfillment center in Istanbul into a Disaster Relief Hub and partnered with local 
organizations to ship hundreds of thousands of relief items to affected regions. Amazon also made cash donations to 
non-governmental organizations and set up donation campaigns across 16 Amazon online stores globally to make it 
easy for customers to support communities impacted by these earthquakes. 
•
Set a record in 2022 for the most renewable energy purchased by a single company in one year. Amazon’s renewable 
energy portfolio now includes 164 wind and solar farms and 237 rooftop solar projects in 22 countries, totaling over 20 
gigawatts—an amount of energy that could power 5.3 million U.S. homes. Amazon has been the largest corporate 
buyer of renewable energy for three years running.
•
Expanded the use of electric delivery vehicles from Rivian, as part of the company’s commitment to dramatically 
reduce its carbon emissions. These custom vans from Rivian have now been used to deliver more than 75 million 
packages in 500 U.S. cities and regions. Amazon began rolling out its electric delivery vans in the summer of 2022 and 
now has thousands on the road.
•
Announced over $22 million in low-rate loans and grants to help build affordable homes in Washington, D.C., and 
Capitol Heights, Maryland. Since creating the Housing Equity Fund in 2021, Amazon has committed nearly $1.6 
billion to help create or preserve affordable homes across Amazon’s hometown communities.
•
Announced funding for 8,000 U.S. schools to provide access to computer science education to more than 2 million 
students by the end of the 2022-2023 academic year through Amazon Future Engineer. By providing professional 
development for teachers, curriculum development, college scholarships, and internships, Amazon aims to inspire 
millions of students from underserved and historically underrepresented communities to pursue careers in science, 
technology, engineering, and math (STEM). 
•
Launched the Zero Emission Maritime Buyers Alliance (ZEMBA) in partnership with the Aspen Institute, Patagonia, 
and Tchibo. ZEMBA will work to reduce the climate impact of maritime shipping by helping to create sustainable 
economic models in renewable energy, zero-emission fuel production, infrastructure, and clean maritime services.
•
Announced that the Right Now Climate Fund is developing the world’s first commercial-scale seaweed farm located 
between offshore wind turbines in the North Sea to help address climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide as it 
grows. The Fund is also helping to create and restore ecosystems for plants and animals as part of its commitment to 
boost biodiversity and currently supports 22 rewilding initiatives in London.
Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of April 27, 2023, and are subject to 
substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and 
spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, 
the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below. Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

Amazon believes that success and scale bring broad responsibility to help the planet, future generations, and local communities 
in which the company has a significant presence. Amazon employees have passion for investing in these areas, and a sampling 
of the efforts from this past quarter are that Amazon: 
•
Activated the company’s global logistics network to support communities impacted by earthquakes in Türkiye and 
Syria. The company turned its fulfillment center in Istanbul into a Disaster Relief Hub and partnered with local 
organizations to ship hundreds of thousands of relief items to affected regions. Amazon also made cash donations to 
non-governmental organizations and set up donation campaigns across 16 Amazon online stores globally to make it 
easy for customers to support communities impacted by these earthquakes. 
•
Set a record in 2022 for the most renewable energy purchased by a single company in one year. Amazon’s renewable 
energy portfolio now includes 164 wind and solar farms and 237 rooftop solar projects in 22 countries, totaling over 20 
gigawatts—an amount of energy that could power 5.3 million U.S. homes. Amazon has been the largest corporate 
buyer of renewable energy for three years running.
•
Expanded the use of electric delivery vehicles from Rivian, as part of the company’s commitment to dramatically 
reduce its carbon emissions. These custom vans from Rivian have now been used to deliver more than 75 million 
packages in 500 U.S. cities and regions. Amazon began rolling out its electric delivery vans in the summer of 2022 and 
now has thousands on the road.
•
Announced over $22 million in low-rate loans and grants to help build affordable homes in Washington, D.C., and 
Capitol Heights, Maryland. Since creating the Housing Equity Fund in 2021, Amazon has committed nearly $1.6 
billion to help create or preserve affordable homes across Amazon’s hometown communities.
•
Announced funding for 8,000 U.S. schools to provide access to computer science education to more than 2 million 
students by the end of the 2022-2023 academic year through Amazon Future Engineer. By providing professional 
development for teachers, curriculum development, college scholarships, and internships, Amazon aims to inspire 
millions of students from underserved and historically underrepresented communities to pursue careers in science, 
technology, engineering, and math (STEM). 
•
Launched the Zero Emission Maritime Buyers Alliance (ZEMBA) in partnership with the Aspen Institute, Patagonia, 
and Tchibo. ZEMBA will work to reduce the climate impact of maritime shipping by helping to create sustainable 
economic models in renewable energy, zero-emission fuel production, infrastructure, and clean maritime services.
•
Announced that the Right Now Climate Fund is developing the world’s first commercial-scale seaweed farm located 
between offshore wind turbines in the North Sea to help address climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide as it 
grows. The Fund is also helping to create and restore ecosystems for plants and animals as part of its commitment to 
boost biodiversity and currently supports 22 rewilding initiatives in London.
Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of April 27, 2023, and are subject to 
substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and 
spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, 
the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below. AMAZON.COM, INC.

N/A Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

N/A Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

N/A Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on

These two statements are not the same.",Amazon's provision for income taxes in Q1 2023 was a benefit of $948 million.,"Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

Supporting communities and protecting the environment
Amazon believes that success and scale bring broad responsibility to help the planet, future generations, and local communities 
in which the company has a significant presence. Amazon employees have passion for investing in these areas, and a sampling 
of the efforts from this past quarter are that Amazon: 
•
Activated the company’s global logistics network to support communities impacted by earthquakes in Türkiye and 
Syria. The company turned its fulfillment center in Istanbul into a Disaster Relief Hub and partnered with local 
organizations to ship hundreds of thousands of relief items to affected regions. Amazon also made cash donations to 
non-governmental organizations and set up donation campaigns across 16 Amazon online stores globally to make it 
easy for customers to support communities impacted by these earthquakes. 
•
Set a record in 2022 for the most renewable energy purchased by a single company in one year. Amazon’s renewable 
energy portfolio now includes 164 wind and solar farms and 237 rooftop solar projects in 22 countries, totaling over 20 
gigawatts—an amount of energy that could power 5.3 million U.S. homes. Amazon has been the largest corporate 
buyer of renewable energy for three years running.
•
Expanded the use of electric delivery vehicles from Rivian, as part of the company’s commitment to dramatically 
reduce its carbon emissions. These custom vans from Rivian have now been used to deliver more than 75 million 
packages in 500 U.S. cities and regions. Amazon began rolling out its electric delivery vans in the summer of 2022 and 
now has thousands on the road.
•
Announced over $22 million in low-rate loans and grants to help build affordable homes in Washington, D.C., and 
Capitol Heights, Maryland. Since creating the Housing Equity Fund in 2021, Amazon has committed nearly $1.6 
billion to help create or preserve affordable homes across Amazon’s hometown communities.
•
Announced funding for 8,000 U.S. schools to provide access to computer science education to more than 2 million 
students by the end of the 2022-2023 academic year through Amazon Future Engineer. By providing professional 
development for teachers, curriculum development, college scholarships, and internships, Amazon aims to inspire 
millions of students from underserved and historically underrepresented communities to pursue careers in science, 
technology, engineering, and math (STEM). 
•
Launched the Zero Emission Maritime Buyers Alliance (ZEMBA) in partnership with the Aspen Institute, Patagonia, 
and Tchibo. ZEMBA will work to reduce the climate impact of maritime shipping by helping to create sustainable 
economic models in renewable energy, zero-emission fuel production, infrastructure, and clean maritime services.
•
Announced that the Right Now Climate Fund is developing the world’s first commercial-scale seaweed farm located

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on

•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate

Reached 1 billion packages handled by Robin, a robotic system used across Amazon’s operations network in the U.S., 
Canada, and Europe. Robin robotic systems use artificial intelligence, computer vision, and machine learning to help 
employees handle and sort customer packages before shipment. For employees, this reduces the number of repetitive 
tasks, improving safety and helping them focus their time and energy on activities that make better use of their talents.
•
Ranked No. 2 on Fortune magazine’s World’s Most Admired Companies list for the seventh year in a row. The annual 
ranking is determined by a survey of top executives and analysts, and companies are evaluated on factors including the 
quality of their management and products, commitments to social responsibility, and ability to attract talent.
•
Introduced Leadership Liftoff, an onboarding program for operations area managers. New managers enrolled in the 
program participate in group sessions, on-the-job training, and self-paced learning to help them gain skills and 
confidence to lead successful teams and foster connections between new leaders. 
Supporting communities and protecting the environment
Amazon believes that success and scale bring broad responsibility to help the planet, future generations, and local communities 
in which the company has a significant presence. Amazon employees have passion for investing in these areas, and a sampling 
of the efforts from this past quarter are that Amazon: 
•
Activated the company’s global logistics network to support communities impacted by earthquakes in Türkiye and 
Syria. The company turned its fulfillment center in Istanbul into a Disaster Relief Hub and partnered with local 
organizations to ship hundreds of thousands of relief items to affected regions. Amazon also made cash donations to 
non-governmental organizations and set up donation campaigns across 16 Amazon online stores globally to make it 
easy for customers to support communities impacted by these earthquakes. 
•
Set a record in 2022 for the most renewable energy purchased by a single company in one year. Amazon’s renewable 
energy portfolio now includes 164 wind and solar farms and 237 rooftop solar projects in 22 countries, totaling over 20 
gigawatts—an amount of energy that could power 5.3 million U.S. homes. Amazon has been the largest corporate 
buyer of renewable energy for three years running.
•
Expanded the use of electric delivery vehicles from Rivian, as part of the company’s commitment to dramatically 
reduce its carbon emissions. These custom vans from Rivian have now been used to deliver more than 75 million 
packages in 500 U.S. cities and regions. Amazon began rolling out its electric delivery vans in the summer of 2022 and 
now has thousands on the road.
•
Announced over $22 million in low-rate loans and grants to help build affordable homes in Washington, D.C., and 
Capitol Heights, Maryland. Since creating the Housing Equity Fund in 2021, Amazon has committed nearly $1.6 
billion to help create or preserve affordable homes across Amazon’s hometown communities.
•
Announced funding for 8,000 U.S. schools to provide access to computer science education to more than 2 million 
students by the end of the 2022-2023 academic year through Amazon Future Engineer. By providing professional 
development for teachers, curriculum development, college scholarships, and internships, Amazon aims to inspire 
millions of students from underserved and historically underrepresented communities to pursue careers in science, 
technology, engineering, and math (STEM). 
•
Launched the Zero Emission Maritime Buyers Alliance (ZEMBA) in partnership with the Aspen Institute, Patagonia, 
and Tchibo. ZEMBA will work to reduce the climate impact of maritime shipping by helping to create sustainable 
economic models in renewable energy, zero-emission fuel production, infrastructure, and clean maritime services.
•
Announced that the Right Now Climate Fund is developing the world’s first commercial-scale seaweed farm located 
between offshore wind turbines in the North Sea to help address climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide as it 
grows. The Fund is also helping to create and restore ecosystems for plants and animals as part of its commitment to 
boost biodiversity and currently supports 22 rewilding initiatives in London.
Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of April 27, 2023, and are subject to 
substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and 
spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, 
the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below. AMAZON.COM, INC.

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

- Reached 1 billion packages handled by Robin, a robotic system used across Amazon’s operations network in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. Robin robotic systems use artificial intelligence, computer vision, and machine learning to help employees handle and sort customer packages before shipment. For employees, this reduces the number of repetitive tasks, improving safety and helping them focus their time and energy on activities that make better use of their talents.
- Ranked No. 2 on Fortune magazine’s World’s Most Admired Companies list for the seventh year in a row. The annual ranking is determined by a survey of top executives and analysts, and companies are evaluated on factors including the quality of their management and products, commitments to social responsibility, and ability to attract talent.
- Introduced Leadership Liftoff, an onboarding program for operations area managers. New managers enrolled in the program participate in group sessions, on-the-job training, and self-paced learning to help them gain skills and confidence to lead successful teams and foster connections between new leaders.

Supporting communities and protecting the environment Amazon believes that success and scale bring broad responsibility to help the planet, future generations, and local communities in which the company has a significant presence. Amazon employees have passion for investing in these areas, and a sampling of the efforts from this past quarter are that Amazon:

- Activated the company’s global logistics network to support communities impacted by earthquakes in Türkiye and Syria. The company turned its fulfillment center in Istanbul into a Disaster Relief Hub and partnered with local organizations to ship hundreds of thousands of relief items to affected regions. Amazon also made cash donations to non-governmental organizations and set up donation campaigns across 16 Amazon online stores globally to make it easy for customers to support communities impacted by these earthquakes.
- Set a record in 2022 for the most renewable energy purchased by a single company in one year. Amazon’s renewable energy portfolio now includes 164 wind and solar farms and 237 rooftop solar projects in 22 countries, totaling over 20 gigawatts—an amount of energy that could power 5.3 million U.S. homes. Amazon has been the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy for three years running.
- Expanded the use of electric delivery vehicles from Rivian, as part of the company’s commitment to dramatically reduce its carbon emissions. These custom vans from Rivian have now been used to deliver more than 75 million packages in 500 U.S. cities and regions. Amazon began rolling out its electric delivery vans in the summer of 2022 and now has thousands on the road.
- Announced over $22 million in low-rate loans and grants to help build affordable homes in Washington, D.C., and Capitol Heights, Maryland. Since creating the Housing Equity Fund in 2021, Amazon has committed nearly $1.6 billion to help create or preserve affordable homes across Amazon’s hometown communities.
- Announced funding for 8,000 U.S. schools to provide access to computer science education to more than 2 million students by the end of the 2022-2023 academic year through Amazon Future Engineer. By providing professional development for teachers, curriculum development, college scholarships, and internships, Amazon aims to inspire millions of students from underserved and historically underrepresented communities to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).
- Launched the Zero Emission Maritime Buyers Alliance (ZEMBA) in partnership with the Aspen Institute, Patagonia, and Tchibo. ZEMBA will work to reduce the climate impact of maritime shipping by helping to create sustainable economic models in renewable energy, zero-emission fuel production, infrastructure, and clean maritime services.
- Announced that the Right Now Climate Fund is developing the world’s first commercial-scale seaweed farm located between offshore wind turbines in the North Sea to help address climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide as it grows. The Fund is also helping to create and restore ecosystems for plants and animals as part of its commitment to boost biodiversity and currently supports 22 rewilding initiatives in London.

Financial Guidance The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of April 27, 2023, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below.",0.0,"The generated answer is incorrect because it states that Amazon spent $33,000 million on purchases of property and equipment in the trailing twelve months ending Q1 2023, while the reference answer indicates that the correct amount is $57,649 million.","Amazon spent $33,000 million on purchases of property and equipment (net of proceeds) in the trailing twelve months ending Q1 2023.","AMAZON.COM, INC.

•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic

Syria. The company turned its fulfillment center in Istanbul into a Disaster Relief Hub and partnered with local 
organizations to ship hundreds of thousands of relief items to affected regions. Amazon also made cash donations to 
non-governmental organizations and set up donation campaigns across 16 Amazon online stores globally to make it 
easy for customers to support communities impacted by these earthquakes.

now has thousands on the road.
•
Announced over $22 million in low-rate loans and grants to help build affordable homes in Washington, D.C., and

spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, 
the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below.","Amazon spent $57,649 million on purchases of property and equipment (net of proceeds) in the trailing twelve months ending Q1 2023, a 1% year-over-year decline.",How much did Amazon spend on purchases of property and equipment (net of proceeds) in the trailing twelve months ending Q1 2023?

financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

About Amazon

Amazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Amazon strives to be Earth’s Most Customer-Centric Company, Earth’s Best Employer, and Earth’s Safest Place to Work. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Career Choice, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, Alexa, Just Walk Out technology, Amazon Studios, and The Climate Pledge are some of the things pioneered by Amazon. For more information, visit amazon.com/about and follow @AmazonNews. technology, vehicle safety controls, and engineered ergonomic solutions to reduce risks for employees, partners, and communities.

- Reached 1 billion packages handled by Robin, a robotic system used across Amazon’s operations network in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. Robin robotic systems use artificial intelligence, computer vision, and machine learning to help employees handle and sort customer packages before shipment. For employees, this reduces the number of repetitive tasks, improving safety and helping them focus their time and energy on activities that make better use of their talents.
- Ranked No. 2 on Fortune magazine’s World’s Most Admired Companies list for the seventh year in a row. The annual ranking is determined by a survey of top executives and analysts, and companies are evaluated on factors including the quality of their management and products, commitments to social responsibility, and ability to attract talent.
- Introduced Leadership Liftoff, an onboarding program for operations area managers. New managers enrolled in the program participate in group sessions, on-the-job training, and self-paced learning to help them gain skills and confidence to lead successful teams and foster connections between new leaders.

Supporting communities and protecting the environment Amazon believes that success and scale bring broad responsibility to help the planet, future generations, and local communities in which the company has a significant presence. Amazon employees have passion for investing in these areas, and a sampling of the efforts from this past quarter are that Amazon:

- Activated the company’s global logistics network to support communities impacted by earthquakes in Türkiye and Syria. The company turned its fulfillment center in Istanbul into a Disaster Relief Hub and partnered with local organizations to ship hundreds of thousands of relief items to affected regions. Amazon also made cash donations to non-governmental organizations and set up donation campaigns across 16 Amazon online stores globally to make it easy for customers to support communities impacted by these earthquakes.
- Set a record in 2022 for the most renewable energy purchased by a single company in one year. Amazon’s renewable energy portfolio now includes 164 wind and solar farms and 237 rooftop solar projects in 22 countries, totaling over 20 gigawatts—an amount of energy that could power 5.3 million U.S. homes. Amazon has been the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy for three years running.
- Expanded the use of electric delivery vehicles from Rivian, as part of the company’s commitment to dramatically reduce its carbon emissions. These custom vans from Rivian have now been used to deliver more than 75 million packages in 500 U.S. cities and regions. Amazon began rolling out its electric delivery vans in the summer of 2022 and now has thousands on the road.
- Announced over $22 million in low-rate loans and grants to help build affordable homes in Washington, D.C., and Capitol Heights, Maryland. Since creating the Housing Equity Fund in 2021, Amazon has committed nearly $1.6 billion to help create or preserve affordable homes across Amazon’s hometown communities.
- Announced funding for 8,000 U.S. schools to provide access to computer science education to more than 2 million students by the end of the 2022-2023 academic year through Amazon Future Engineer. By providing professional development for teachers, curriculum development, college scholarships, and internships, Amazon aims to inspire millions of students from underserved and historically underrepresented communities to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).
- Launched the Zero Emission Maritime Buyers Alliance (ZEMBA) in partnership with the Aspen Institute, Patagonia, and Tchibo. ZEMBA will work to reduce the climate impact of maritime shipping by helping to create sustainable economic models in renewable energy, zero-emission fuel production, infrastructure, and clean maritime services.
- Announced that the Right Now Climate Fund is developing the world’s first commercial-scale seaweed farm located between offshore wind turbines in the North Sea to help address climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide as it grows. The Fund is also helping to create and restore ecosystems for plants and animals as part of its commitment to boost biodiversity and currently supports 22 rewilding initiatives in London.

Financial Guidance The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of April 27, 2023, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below.",1.0,"The generated answer correctly states the amount Amazon spent on principal repayments of finance leases in the trailing twelve months ending Q1 2023, which matches the reference answer.

5,845 Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

Jassy, Amazon CEO. “Our Stores business is continuing to improve the cost to serve in our fulfillment network while 
increasing the speed with which we get products into the hands of customers (we expect to have our fastest Prime delivery 
speeds ever in 2023). Our Advertising business continues to deliver robust growth, largely due to our ongoing machine learning 
investments that help customers see relevant information when they engage with us, which in turn delivers unusually strong 
results for brands. And, while our AWS business navigates companies spending more cautiously in this macro environment, we 
continue to prioritize building long-term customer relationships both by helping customers save money and enabling them to 
more easily leverage technologies like Large Language Models and Generative AI with our uniquely cost-effective machine 
learning chips (“Trainium” and “Inferentia”), managed Large Language Models (“Bedrock”), and AI code companion 
CodeWhisperer. We like the fundamentals we’re seeing in AWS, and believe there’s much growth ahead.”

selling partners from counterfeit products in 2022. The efforts resulted in more seized products, criminal referrals, and 
industry partnerships than ever before. The report demonstrates how Amazon is stopping bad actors and making an 
impact beyond Amazon’s store, including by identifying, seizing, and appropriately disposing of more than 6 million 
counterfeit products, preventing them from reaching customers and being resold elsewhere in the global supply chain.

Supporting communities and protecting the environment
Amazon believes that success and scale bring broad responsibility to help the planet, future generations, and local communities 
in which the company has a significant presence. Amazon employees have passion for investing in these areas, and a sampling 
of the efforts from this past quarter are that Amazon: 
•
Activated the company’s global logistics network to support communities impacted by earthquakes in Türkiye and 
Syria. The company turned its fulfillment center in Istanbul into a Disaster Relief Hub and partnered with local 
organizations to ship hundreds of thousands of relief items to affected regions. Amazon also made cash donations to 
non-governmental organizations and set up donation campaigns across 16 Amazon online stores globally to make it

Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of April 27, 2023, and are subject to 
substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and 
spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, 
the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below. Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain

Supporting communities and protecting the environment Amazon believes that success and scale bring broad responsibility to help the planet, future generations, and local communities in which the company has a significant presence. Amazon employees have passion for investing in these areas, and a sampling of the efforts from this past quarter are that Amazon:

- Activated the company’s global logistics network to support communities impacted by earthquakes in Türkiye and Syria. The company turned its fulfillment center in Istanbul into a Disaster Relief Hub and partnered with local organizations to ship hundreds of thousands of relief items to affected regions. Amazon also made cash donations to non-governmental organizations and set up donation campaigns across 16 Amazon online stores globally to make it easy for customers to support communities impacted by these earthquakes.
- Set a record in 2022 for the most renewable energy purchased by a single company in one year. Amazon’s renewable energy portfolio now includes 164 wind and solar farms and 237 rooftop solar projects in 22 countries, totaling over 20 gigawatts—an amount of energy that could power 5.3 million U.S. homes. Amazon has been the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy for three years running.
- Expanded the use of electric delivery vehicles from Rivian, as part of the company’s commitment to dramatically reduce its carbon emissions. These custom vans from Rivian have now been used to deliver more than 75 million packages in 500 U.S. cities and regions. Amazon began rolling out its electric delivery vans in the summer of 2022 and now has thousands on the road.
- Announced over $22 million in low-rate loans and grants to help build affordable homes in Washington, D.C., and Capitol Heights, Maryland. Since creating the Housing Equity Fund in 2021, Amazon has committed nearly $1.6 billion to help create or preserve affordable homes across Amazon’s hometown communities.
- Announced funding for 8,000 U.S. schools to provide access to computer science education to more than 2 million students by the end of the 2022-2023 academic year through Amazon Future Engineer. By providing professional development for teachers, curriculum development, college scholarships, and internships, Amazon aims to inspire millions of students from underserved and historically underrepresented communities to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).
- Launched the Zero Emission Maritime Buyers Alliance (ZEMBA) in partnership with the Aspen Institute, Patagonia, and Tchibo. ZEMBA will work to reduce the climate impact of maritime shipping by helping to create sustainable economic models in renewable energy, zero-emission fuel production, infrastructure, and clean maritime services.
- Announced that the Right Now Climate Fund is developing the world’s first commercial-scale seaweed farm located between offshore wind turbines in the North Sea to help address climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide as it grows. The Fund is also helping to create and restore ecosystems for plants and animals as part of its commitment to boost biodiversity and currently supports 22 rewilding initiatives in London.

Financial Guidance The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of April 27, 2023, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below. “There’s a lot to like about how our teams are delivering for customers, particularly amidst an uncertain economy,” said Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO. “Our Stores business is continuing to improve the cost to serve in our fulfillment network while increasing the speed with which we get products into the hands of customers (we expect to have our fastest Prime delivery speeds ever in 2023). Our Advertising business continues to deliver robust growth, largely due to our ongoing machine learning investments that help customers see relevant information when they engage with us, which in turn delivers unusually strong results for brands. And, while our AWS business navigates companies spending more cautiously in this macro environment, we continue to prioritize building long-term customer relationships both by helping customers save money and enabling them to more easily leverage technologies like Large Language Models and Generative AI with our uniquely cost-effective machine learning chips (“Trainium” and “Inferentia”), managed Large Language Models (“Bedrock”), and AI code companion CodeWhisperer. We like the fundamentals we’re seeing in AWS, and believe there’s much growth ahead.”

Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of April 27, 2023, and are subject to 
substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and 
spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, 
the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below. Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

N/A Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain

|Net sales|Increased 9% to $127.4 billion in the first quarter, compared with $116.4 billion in first quarter 2022. Excluding the $2.4 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter, net sales increased 11% compared with first quarter 2022.|

All share and per share information for comparable prior year periods throughout this release have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the 20-for-1 stock split effected on May 27, 2022.|
|First quarter 2023 net income|Includes a pre-tax valuation loss of $0.5 billion included in non-operating expense from the common stock investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc., compared to a pre-tax valuation loss of $7.6 billion from the investment in first quarter 2022.|

|Net sales|are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from foreign exchange rates.|
|---|---|
|Operating income|is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 2022.|
|This guidance assumes|among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.|

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

SEATTLE—(BUSINESS WIRE) April 27, 2023—Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced financial results

•
Net sales increased 9% to $127.4 billion in the first quarter, compared with $116.4 billion in first quarter 2022.
Excluding the $2.4 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the

•
North America segment sales increased 11% year-over-year to $76.9 billion.
•

•
Net income was $3.2 billion in the first quarter, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared with net loss of $3.8 billion, or
$0.38 per diluted share, in first quarter 2022. All share and per share information for comparable prior year periods
throughout this release have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the 20-for-1 stock split effected on May 27, 2022.
•
First quarter 2023 net income includes a pre-tax valuation loss of $0.5 billion included in non-operating
expense from the common stock investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc., compared to a pre-tax valuation loss

•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

|Net sales|are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from foreign exchange rates.|
|---|---|
|Operating income|is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 2022.|
|This guidance assumes|among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.|

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

Excludes the impact of Whole Foods Market. Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

•
North America segment sales increased 11% year-over-year to $76.9 billion.

•
Net income was $3.2 billion in the first quarter, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared with net loss of $3.8 billion, or
$0.38 per diluted share, in first quarter 2022. All share and per share information for comparable prior year periods
throughout this release have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the 20-for-1 stock split effected on May 27, 2022.
•
First quarter 2023 net income includes a pre-tax valuation loss of $0.5 billion included in non-operating
expense from the common stock investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc., compared to a pre-tax valuation loss
of $7.6 billion from the investment in first quarter 2022.

•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information

Excludes the impact of Whole Foods Market. Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

Excludes the impact of Whole Foods Market. Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in

SEATTLE—(BUSINESS WIRE) April 27, 2023—Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced financial results 
for its first quarter ended March 31, 2023. 
•
Net sales increased 9% to $127.4 billion in the first quarter, compared with $116.4 billion in first quarter 2022.
Excluding the $2.4 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the
quarter, net sales increased 11% compared with first quarter 2022.
•
North America segment sales increased 11% year-over-year to $76.9 billion.
•
International segment sales increased 1% year-over-year to $29.1 billion, or increased 9% excluding changes
in foreign exchange rates.
•
AWS segment sales increased 16% year-over-year to $21.4 billion.
•
Operating income increased to $4.8 billion in the first quarter, compared with $3.7 billion in first quarter 2022. First
quarter 2023 operating income includes approximately $0.5 billion of charges related to estimated severance costs.
•
North America segment operating income was $0.9 billion, compared with operating loss of $1.6 billion in
first quarter 2022.
•
International segment operating loss was $1.2 billion, compared with operating loss of $1.3 billion in first
quarter 2022.
•
AWS segment operating income was $5.1 billion, compared with operating income of $6.5 billion in first
quarter 2022.
•
Net income was $3.2 billion in the first quarter, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared with net loss of $3.8 billion, or
$0.38 per diluted share, in first quarter 2022. All share and per share information for comparable prior year periods
throughout this release have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the 20-for-1 stock split effected on May 27, 2022.
•
First quarter 2023 net income includes a pre-tax valuation loss of $0.5 billion included in non-operating
expense from the common stock investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc., compared to a pre-tax valuation loss
of $7.6 billion from the investment in first quarter 2022.
•
Operating cash flow increased 38% to $54.3 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with $39.3 billion for
the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2022.
•
Free cash flow improved to an outflow of $3.3 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with an outflow of
$18.6 billion for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2022.
•
Free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations improved to an outflow of
$10.1 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with an outflow of $29.3 billion for the trailing twelve months
ended March 31, 2022.

obligations improved to an outflow of $4.5 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with an outflow of $22.3
billion for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2022. Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

 100 % Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

SEATTLE—(BUSINESS WIRE) April 27, 2023—Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced financial results 
for its first quarter ended March 31, 2023. 
•
Net sales increased 9% to $127.4 billion in the first quarter, compared with $116.4 billion in first quarter 2022.
Excluding the $2.4 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the
quarter, net sales increased 11% compared with first quarter 2022.
•
North America segment sales increased 11% year-over-year to $76.9 billion.
•
International segment sales increased 1% year-over-year to $29.1 billion, or increased 9% excluding changes

•
AWS segment sales increased 16% year-over-year to $21.4 billion.
•
Operating income increased to $4.8 billion in the first quarter, compared with $3.7 billion in first quarter 2022. First

•
North America segment operating income was $0.9 billion, compared with operating loss of $1.6 billion in
first quarter 2022.
•
International segment operating loss was $1.2 billion, compared with operating loss of $1.3 billion in first
quarter 2022.
•
AWS segment operating income was $5.1 billion, compared with operating income of $6.5 billion in first
quarter 2022.
•
Net income was $3.2 billion in the first quarter, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared with net loss of $3.8 billion, or
$0.38 per diluted share, in first quarter 2022. All share and per share information for comparable prior year periods
throughout this release have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the 20-for-1 stock split effected on May 27, 2022.
•
First quarter 2023 net income includes a pre-tax valuation loss of $0.5 billion included in non-operating
expense from the common stock investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc., compared to a pre-tax valuation loss
of $7.6 billion from the investment in first quarter 2022.
•

the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2022.
•
Free cash flow improved to an outflow of $3.3 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with an outflow of
$18.6 billion for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2022.
•

obligations improved to an outflow of $4.5 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with an outflow of $22.3
billion for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2022. Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

SEATTLE—(BUSINESS WIRE) April 27, 2023—Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced financial results 
for its first quarter ended March 31, 2023. 
•
Net sales increased 9% to $127.4 billion in the first quarter, compared with $116.4 billion in first quarter 2022.
Excluding the $2.4 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the
quarter, net sales increased 11% compared with first quarter 2022.
•
North America segment sales increased 11% year-over-year to $76.9 billion.
•
International segment sales increased 1% year-over-year to $29.1 billion, or increased 9% excluding changes
in foreign exchange rates.
•
AWS segment sales increased 16% year-over-year to $21.4 billion.
•
Operating income increased to $4.8 billion in the first quarter, compared with $3.7 billion in first quarter 2022. First
quarter 2023 operating income includes approximately $0.5 billion of charges related to estimated severance costs.
•
North America segment operating income was $0.9 billion, compared with operating loss of $1.6 billion in
first quarter 2022.
•
International segment operating loss was $1.2 billion, compared with operating loss of $1.3 billion in first
quarter 2022.
•
AWS segment operating income was $5.1 billion, compared with operating income of $6.5 billion in first
quarter 2022.
•
Net income was $3.2 billion in the first quarter, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared with net loss of $3.8 billion, or
$0.38 per diluted share, in first quarter 2022. All share and per share information for comparable prior year periods
throughout this release have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the 20-for-1 stock split effected on May 27, 2022.
•
First quarter 2023 net income includes a pre-tax valuation loss of $0.5 billion included in non-operating
expense from the common stock investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc., compared to a pre-tax valuation loss
of $7.6 billion from the investment in first quarter 2022.
•
Operating cash flow increased 38% to $54.3 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with $39.3 billion for
the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2022.
•
Free cash flow improved to an outflow of $3.3 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with an outflow of
$18.6 billion for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2022.
•
Free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations improved to an outflow of
$10.1 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with an outflow of $29.3 billion for the trailing twelve months
ended March 31, 2022.
•
Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing
obligations improved to an outflow of $4.5 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with an outflow of $22.3
billion for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2022. Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic

Excludes the impact of Whole Foods Market. Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

Excludes the impact of Whole Foods Market. Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain

•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information

Reached 1 billion packages handled by Robin, a robotic system used across Amazon’s operations network in the U.S., 
Canada, and Europe. Robin robotic systems use artificial intelligence, computer vision, and machine learning to help 
employees handle and sort customer packages before shipment. For employees, this reduces the number of repetitive 
tasks, improving safety and helping them focus their time and energy on activities that make better use of their talents.
•
Ranked No. 2 on Fortune magazine’s World’s Most Admired Companies list for the seventh year in a row. The annual 
ranking is determined by a survey of top executives and analysts, and companies are evaluated on factors including the 
quality of their management and products, commitments to social responsibility, and ability to attract talent.
•
Introduced Leadership Liftoff, an onboarding program for operations area managers. New managers enrolled in the 
program participate in group sessions, on-the-job training, and self-paced learning to help them gain skills and 
confidence to lead successful teams and foster connections between new leaders. 
Supporting communities and protecting the environment
Amazon believes that success and scale bring broad responsibility to help the planet, future generations, and local communities 
in which the company has a significant presence. Amazon employees have passion for investing in these areas, and a sampling 
of the efforts from this past quarter are that Amazon: 
•
Activated the company’s global logistics network to support communities impacted by earthquakes in Türkiye and 
Syria. The company turned its fulfillment center in Istanbul into a Disaster Relief Hub and partnered with local 
organizations to ship hundreds of thousands of relief items to affected regions. Amazon also made cash donations to 
non-governmental organizations and set up donation campaigns across 16 Amazon online stores globally to make it 
easy for customers to support communities impacted by these earthquakes. 
•
Set a record in 2022 for the most renewable energy purchased by a single company in one year. Amazon’s renewable 
energy portfolio now includes 164 wind and solar farms and 237 rooftop solar projects in 22 countries, totaling over 20 
gigawatts—an amount of energy that could power 5.3 million U.S. homes. Amazon has been the largest corporate 
buyer of renewable energy for three years running.
•
Expanded the use of electric delivery vehicles from Rivian, as part of the company’s commitment to dramatically 
reduce its carbon emissions. These custom vans from Rivian have now been used to deliver more than 75 million 
packages in 500 U.S. cities and regions. Amazon began rolling out its electric delivery vans in the summer of 2022 and 
now has thousands on the road.
•
Announced over $22 million in low-rate loans and grants to help build affordable homes in Washington, D.C., and 
Capitol Heights, Maryland. Since creating the Housing Equity Fund in 2021, Amazon has committed nearly $1.6 
billion to help create or preserve affordable homes across Amazon’s hometown communities.
•
Announced funding for 8,000 U.S. schools to provide access to computer science education to more than 2 million 
students by the end of the 2022-2023 academic year through Amazon Future Engineer. By providing professional 
development for teachers, curriculum development, college scholarships, and internships, Amazon aims to inspire 
millions of students from underserved and historically underrepresented communities to pursue careers in science, 
technology, engineering, and math (STEM). 
•
Launched the Zero Emission Maritime Buyers Alliance (ZEMBA) in partnership with the Aspen Institute, Patagonia, 
and Tchibo. ZEMBA will work to reduce the climate impact of maritime shipping by helping to create sustainable 
economic models in renewable energy, zero-emission fuel production, infrastructure, and clean maritime services.
•
Announced that the Right Now Climate Fund is developing the world’s first commercial-scale seaweed farm located 
between offshore wind turbines in the North Sea to help address climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide as it 
grows. The Fund is also helping to create and restore ecosystems for plants and animals as part of its commitment to 
boost biodiversity and currently supports 22 rewilding initiatives in London.
Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of April 27, 2023, and are subject to 
substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and 
spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, 
the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below.",1.0,"The generated answer correctly identifies the stock-based compensation expenses for Amazon's fulfillment in Q1 2023 as $603 million, which matches the reference answer.","In Q1 2023, Amazon's stock-based compensation expenses for fulfillment were $603 million.","# AMAZON.COM, INC.

|Net sales|are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from foreign exchange rates.|
|---|---|
|Operating income|is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 2022.|
|This guidance assumes|among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.|

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

- Reached 1 billion packages handled by Robin, a robotic system used across Amazon’s operations network in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. Robin robotic systems use artificial intelligence, computer vision, and machine learning to help employees handle and sort customer packages before shipment. For employees, this reduces the number of repetitive tasks, improving safety and helping them focus their time and energy on activities that make better use of their talents.
- Ranked No. 2 on Fortune magazine’s World’s Most Admired Companies list for the seventh year in a row. The annual ranking is determined by a survey of top executives and analysts, and companies are evaluated on factors including the quality of their management and products, commitments to social responsibility, and ability to attract talent.
- Introduced Leadership Liftoff, an onboarding program for operations area managers. New managers enrolled in the program participate in group sessions, on-the-job training, and self-paced learning to help them gain skills and confidence to lead successful teams and foster connections between new leaders.

Supporting communities and protecting the environment Amazon believes that success and scale bring broad responsibility to help the planet, future generations, and local communities in which the company has a significant presence. Amazon employees have passion for investing in these areas, and a sampling of the efforts from this past quarter are that Amazon:

- Activated the company’s global logistics network to support communities impacted by earthquakes in Türkiye and Syria. The company turned its fulfillment center in Istanbul into a Disaster Relief Hub and partnered with local organizations to ship hundreds of thousands of relief items to affected regions. Amazon also made cash donations to non-governmental organizations and set up donation campaigns across 16 Amazon online stores globally to make it easy for customers to support communities impacted by these earthquakes.
- Set a record in 2022 for the most renewable energy purchased by a single company in one year. Amazon’s renewable energy portfolio now includes 164 wind and solar farms and 237 rooftop solar projects in 22 countries, totaling over 20 gigawatts—an amount of energy that could power 5.3 million U.S. homes. Amazon has been the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy for three years running.
- Expanded the use of electric delivery vehicles from Rivian, as part of the company’s commitment to dramatically reduce its carbon emissions. These custom vans from Rivian have now been used to deliver more than 75 million packages in 500 U.S. cities and regions. Amazon began rolling out its electric delivery vans in the summer of 2022 and now has thousands on the road.
- Announced over $22 million in low-rate loans and grants to help build affordable homes in Washington, D.C., and Capitol Heights, Maryland. Since creating the Housing Equity Fund in 2021, Amazon has committed nearly $1.6 billion to help create or preserve affordable homes across Amazon’s hometown communities.
- Announced funding for 8,000 U.S. schools to provide access to computer science education to more than 2 million students by the end of the 2022-2023 academic year through Amazon Future Engineer. By providing professional development for teachers, curriculum development, college scholarships, and internships, Amazon aims to inspire millions of students from underserved and historically underrepresented communities to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).
- Launched the Zero Emission Maritime Buyers Alliance (ZEMBA) in partnership with the Aspen Institute, Patagonia, and Tchibo. ZEMBA will work to reduce the climate impact of maritime shipping by helping to create sustainable economic models in renewable energy, zero-emission fuel production, infrastructure, and clean maritime services.
- Announced that the Right Now Climate Fund is developing the world’s first commercial-scale seaweed farm located between offshore wind turbines in the North Sea to help address climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide as it grows. The Fund is also helping to create and restore ecosystems for plants and animals as part of its commitment to boost biodiversity and currently supports 22 rewilding initiatives in London.

Financial Guidance The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of April 27, 2023, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below. # AMAZON.COM, INC.

5,845 Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in

Reached 1 billion packages handled by Robin, a robotic system used across Amazon’s operations network in the U.S., 
Canada, and Europe. Robin robotic systems use artificial intelligence, computer vision, and machine learning to help 
employees handle and sort customer packages before shipment. For employees, this reduces the number of repetitive 
tasks, improving safety and helping them focus their time and energy on activities that make better use of their talents.

Ranked No. 2 on Fortune magazine’s World’s Most Admired Companies list for the seventh year in a row. The annual 
ranking is determined by a survey of top executives and analysts, and companies are evaluated on factors including the 
quality of their management and products, commitments to social responsibility, and ability to attract talent.
•
Introduced Leadership Liftoff, an onboarding program for operations area managers. New managers enrolled in the 
program participate in group sessions, on-the-job training, and self-paced learning to help them gain skills and 
confidence to lead successful teams and foster connections between new leaders. 
Supporting communities and protecting the environment
Amazon believes that success and scale bring broad responsibility to help the planet, future generations, and local communities 
in which the company has a significant presence. Amazon employees have passion for investing in these areas, and a sampling 
of the efforts from this past quarter are that Amazon: 
•
Activated the company’s global logistics network to support communities impacted by earthquakes in Türkiye and 
Syria. The company turned its fulfillment center in Istanbul into a Disaster Relief Hub and partnered with local 
organizations to ship hundreds of thousands of relief items to affected regions. Amazon also made cash donations to 
non-governmental organizations and set up donation campaigns across 16 Amazon online stores globally to make it 
easy for customers to support communities impacted by these earthquakes. 
•
Set a record in 2022 for the most renewable energy purchased by a single company in one year. Amazon’s renewable 
energy portfolio now includes 164 wind and solar farms and 237 rooftop solar projects in 22 countries, totaling over 20 
gigawatts—an amount of energy that could power 5.3 million U.S. homes. Amazon has been the largest corporate 
buyer of renewable energy for three years running.
•
Expanded the use of electric delivery vehicles from Rivian, as part of the company’s commitment to dramatically 
reduce its carbon emissions. These custom vans from Rivian have now been used to deliver more than 75 million 
packages in 500 U.S. cities and regions. Amazon began rolling out its electric delivery vans in the summer of 2022 and 
now has thousands on the road.
•
Announced over $22 million in low-rate loans and grants to help build affordable homes in Washington, D.C., and 
Capitol Heights, Maryland. Since creating the Housing Equity Fund in 2021, Amazon has committed nearly $1.6 
billion to help create or preserve affordable homes across Amazon’s hometown communities.
•
Announced funding for 8,000 U.S. schools to provide access to computer science education to more than 2 million 
students by the end of the 2022-2023 academic year through Amazon Future Engineer. By providing professional 
development for teachers, curriculum development, college scholarships, and internships, Amazon aims to inspire 
millions of students from underserved and historically underrepresented communities to pursue careers in science, 
technology, engineering, and math (STEM). 
•
Launched the Zero Emission Maritime Buyers Alliance (ZEMBA) in partnership with the Aspen Institute, Patagonia, 
and Tchibo. ZEMBA will work to reduce the climate impact of maritime shipping by helping to create sustainable 
economic models in renewable energy, zero-emission fuel production, infrastructure, and clean maritime services.
•
Announced that the Right Now Climate Fund is developing the world’s first commercial-scale seaweed farm located 
between offshore wind turbines in the North Sea to help address climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide as it 
grows. The Fund is also helping to create and restore ecosystems for plants and animals as part of its commitment to 
boost biodiversity and currently supports 22 rewilding initiatives in London.

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

5,845 Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

Excludes the impact of Whole Foods Market. Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.

variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in

•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity.

5,845 Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

5,845 Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

464,378 Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

464,378 Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us.

foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.

This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on

•
Ranked No. 2 on Fortune magazine’s World’s Most Admired Companies list for the seventh year in a row. The annual

•
Introduced Leadership Liftoff, an onboarding program for operations area managers. New managers enrolled in the 
program participate in group sessions, on-the-job training, and self-paced learning to help them gain skills and 
confidence to lead successful teams and foster connections between new leaders. 
Supporting communities and protecting the environment
Amazon believes that success and scale bring broad responsibility to help the planet, future generations, and local communities 
in which the company has a significant presence. Amazon employees have passion for investing in these areas, and a sampling 
of the efforts from this past quarter are that Amazon: 
•
Activated the company’s global logistics network to support communities impacted by earthquakes in Türkiye and 
Syria. The company turned its fulfillment center in Istanbul into a Disaster Relief Hub and partnered with local 
organizations to ship hundreds of thousands of relief items to affected regions. Amazon also made cash donations to 
non-governmental organizations and set up donation campaigns across 16 Amazon online stores globally to make it 
easy for customers to support communities impacted by these earthquakes. 
•
Set a record in 2022 for the most renewable energy purchased by a single company in one year. Amazon’s renewable 
energy portfolio now includes 164 wind and solar farms and 237 rooftop solar projects in 22 countries, totaling over 20 
gigawatts—an amount of energy that could power 5.3 million U.S. homes. Amazon has been the largest corporate 
buyer of renewable energy for three years running.
•
Expanded the use of electric delivery vehicles from Rivian, as part of the company’s commitment to dramatically 
reduce its carbon emissions. These custom vans from Rivian have now been used to deliver more than 75 million 
packages in 500 U.S. cities and regions. Amazon began rolling out its electric delivery vans in the summer of 2022 and 
now has thousands on the road.
•
Announced over $22 million in low-rate loans and grants to help build affordable homes in Washington, D.C., and 
Capitol Heights, Maryland. Since creating the Housing Equity Fund in 2021, Amazon has committed nearly $1.6 
billion to help create or preserve affordable homes across Amazon’s hometown communities.
•
Announced funding for 8,000 U.S. schools to provide access to computer science education to more than 2 million 
students by the end of the 2022-2023 academic year through Amazon Future Engineer. By providing professional 
development for teachers, curriculum development, college scholarships, and internships, Amazon aims to inspire 
millions of students from underserved and historically underrepresented communities to pursue careers in science, 
technology, engineering, and math (STEM). 
•
Launched the Zero Emission Maritime Buyers Alliance (ZEMBA) in partnership with the Aspen Institute, Patagonia, 
and Tchibo. ZEMBA will work to reduce the climate impact of maritime shipping by helping to create sustainable 
economic models in renewable energy, zero-emission fuel production, infrastructure, and clean maritime services.
•
Announced that the Right Now Climate Fund is developing the world’s first commercial-scale seaweed farm located 
between offshore wind turbines in the North Sea to help address climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide as it 
grows. The Fund is also helping to create and restore ecosystems for plants and animals as part of its commitment to 
boost biodiversity and currently supports 22 rewilding initiatives in London.
Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of April 27, 2023, and are subject to 
substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and 
spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, 
the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below. AMAZON.COM, INC.

|Net sales|Increased 9% to $127.4 billion in the first quarter, compared with $116.4 billion in first quarter 2022. Excluding the $2.4 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter, net sales increased 11% compared with first quarter 2022.|

All share and per share information for comparable prior year periods throughout this release have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the 20-for-1 stock split effected on May 27, 2022.|
|First quarter 2023 net income|Includes a pre-tax valuation loss of $0.5 billion included in non-operating expense from the common stock investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc., compared to a pre-tax valuation loss of $7.6 billion from the investment in first quarter 2022.|

|Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations|Improved to an outflow of $4.5 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with an outflow of $22.3 billion for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2022.| Second Quarter 2023 Guidance

|Net sales|are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from foreign exchange rates.|
|---|---|
|Operating income|is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 2022.|
|This guidance assumes|among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.|

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Reached 1 billion packages handled by Robin, a robotic system used across Amazon’s operations network in the U.S., 
Canada, and Europe. Robin robotic systems use artificial intelligence, computer vision, and machine learning to help 
employees handle and sort customer packages before shipment. For employees, this reduces the number of repetitive 
tasks, improving safety and helping them focus their time and energy on activities that make better use of their talents.
•
Ranked No. 2 on Fortune magazine’s World’s Most Admired Companies list for the seventh year in a row. The annual 
ranking is determined by a survey of top executives and analysts, and companies are evaluated on factors including the 
quality of their management and products, commitments to social responsibility, and ability to attract talent.
•
Introduced Leadership Liftoff, an onboarding program for operations area managers. New managers enrolled in the 
program participate in group sessions, on-the-job training, and self-paced learning to help them gain skills and 
confidence to lead successful teams and foster connections between new leaders. 
Supporting communities and protecting the environment
Amazon believes that success and scale bring broad responsibility to help the planet, future generations, and local communities 
in which the company has a significant presence. Amazon employees have passion for investing in these areas, and a sampling 
of the efforts from this past quarter are that Amazon: 
•
Activated the company’s global logistics network to support communities impacted by earthquakes in Türkiye and 
Syria. The company turned its fulfillment center in Istanbul into a Disaster Relief Hub and partnered with local 
organizations to ship hundreds of thousands of relief items to affected regions. Amazon also made cash donations to 
non-governmental organizations and set up donation campaigns across 16 Amazon online stores globally to make it 
easy for customers to support communities impacted by these earthquakes. 
•
Set a record in 2022 for the most renewable energy purchased by a single company in one year. Amazon’s renewable 
energy portfolio now includes 164 wind and solar farms and 237 rooftop solar projects in 22 countries, totaling over 20 
gigawatts—an amount of energy that could power 5.3 million U.S. homes. Amazon has been the largest corporate 
buyer of renewable energy for three years running.
•
Expanded the use of electric delivery vehicles from Rivian, as part of the company’s commitment to dramatically 
reduce its carbon emissions. These custom vans from Rivian have now been used to deliver more than 75 million 
packages in 500 U.S. cities and regions. Amazon began rolling out its electric delivery vans in the summer of 2022 and 
now has thousands on the road.
•
Announced over $22 million in low-rate loans and grants to help build affordable homes in Washington, D.C., and 
Capitol Heights, Maryland. Since creating the Housing Equity Fund in 2021, Amazon has committed nearly $1.6 
billion to help create or preserve affordable homes across Amazon’s hometown communities.
•
Announced funding for 8,000 U.S. schools to provide access to computer science education to more than 2 million 
students by the end of the 2022-2023 academic year through Amazon Future Engineer. By providing professional 
development for teachers, curriculum development, college scholarships, and internships, Amazon aims to inspire 
millions of students from underserved and historically underrepresented communities to pursue careers in science, 
technology, engineering, and math (STEM). 
•
Launched the Zero Emission Maritime Buyers Alliance (ZEMBA) in partnership with the Aspen Institute, Patagonia, 
and Tchibo. ZEMBA will work to reduce the climate impact of maritime shipping by helping to create sustainable 
economic models in renewable energy, zero-emission fuel production, infrastructure, and clean maritime services.
•
Announced that the Right Now Climate Fund is developing the world’s first commercial-scale seaweed farm located 
between offshore wind turbines in the North Sea to help address climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide as it 
grows. The Fund is also helping to create and restore ecosystems for plants and animals as part of its commitment to 
boost biodiversity and currently supports 22 rewilding initiatives in London.
Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of April 27, 2023, and are subject to 
substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and 
spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, 
the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below.",1.0,"The generated answer correctly states the number of outstanding shares for Amazon in Q1 2023, which matches the reference answer.

•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain

Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of April 27, 2023, and are subject to 
substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and 
spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, 
the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below. Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain

- Reached 1 billion packages handled by Robin, a robotic system used across Amazon’s operations network in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. Robin robotic systems use artificial intelligence, computer vision, and machine learning to help employees handle and sort customer packages before shipment. For employees, this reduces the number of repetitive tasks, improving safety and helping them focus their time and energy on activities that make better use of their talents.
- Ranked No. 2 on Fortune magazine’s World’s Most Admired Companies list for the seventh year in a row. The annual ranking is determined by a survey of top executives and analysts, and companies are evaluated on factors including the quality of their management and products, commitments to social responsibility, and ability to attract talent.
- Introduced Leadership Liftoff, an onboarding program for operations area managers. New managers enrolled in the program participate in group sessions, on-the-job training, and self-paced learning to help them gain skills and confidence to lead successful teams and foster connections between new leaders.

Supporting communities and protecting the environment Amazon believes that success and scale bring broad responsibility to help the planet, future generations, and local communities in which the company has a significant presence. Amazon employees have passion for investing in these areas, and a sampling of the efforts from this past quarter are that Amazon:

- Activated the company’s global logistics network to support communities impacted by earthquakes in Türkiye and Syria. The company turned its fulfillment center in Istanbul into a Disaster Relief Hub and partnered with local organizations to ship hundreds of thousands of relief items to affected regions. Amazon also made cash donations to non-governmental organizations and set up donation campaigns across 16 Amazon online stores globally to make it easy for customers to support communities impacted by these earthquakes.
- Set a record in 2022 for the most renewable energy purchased by a single company in one year. Amazon’s renewable energy portfolio now includes 164 wind and solar farms and 237 rooftop solar projects in 22 countries, totaling over 20 gigawatts—an amount of energy that could power 5.3 million U.S. homes. Amazon has been the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy for three years running.
- Expanded the use of electric delivery vehicles from Rivian, as part of the company’s commitment to dramatically reduce its carbon emissions. These custom vans from Rivian have now been used to deliver more than 75 million packages in 500 U.S. cities and regions. Amazon began rolling out its electric delivery vans in the summer of 2022 and now has thousands on the road.
- Announced over $22 million in low-rate loans and grants to help build affordable homes in Washington, D.C., and Capitol Heights, Maryland. Since creating the Housing Equity Fund in 2021, Amazon has committed nearly $1.6 billion to help create or preserve affordable homes across Amazon’s hometown communities.
- Announced funding for 8,000 U.S. schools to provide access to computer science education to more than 2 million students by the end of the 2022-2023 academic year through Amazon Future Engineer. By providing professional development for teachers, curriculum development, college scholarships, and internships, Amazon aims to inspire millions of students from underserved and historically underrepresented communities to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).
- Launched the Zero Emission Maritime Buyers Alliance (ZEMBA) in partnership with the Aspen Institute, Patagonia, and Tchibo. ZEMBA will work to reduce the climate impact of maritime shipping by helping to create sustainable economic models in renewable energy, zero-emission fuel production, infrastructure, and clean maritime services.
- Announced that the Right Now Climate Fund is developing the world’s first commercial-scale seaweed farm located between offshore wind turbines in the North Sea to help address climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide as it grows. The Fund is also helping to create and restore ecosystems for plants and animals as part of its commitment to boost biodiversity and currently supports 22 rewilding initiatives in London.

Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below.",0.0,"The generated answer is incorrect.

Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of April 27, 2023, and are subject to 
substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and 
spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, 
the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below.","Amazon had 367 stock-based awards outstanding in Q1 2023, a 30% year-over-year increase.",How many stock-based awards were outstanding for Amazon in Q1 2023?

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

|Net sales|are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from foreign exchange rates.|
|---|---|
|Operating income|is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 2022.|
|This guidance assumes|among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.|

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

- Reached 1 billion packages handled by Robin, a robotic system used across Amazon’s operations network in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. Robin robotic systems use artificial intelligence, computer vision, and machine learning to help employees handle and sort customer packages before shipment. For employees, this reduces the number of repetitive tasks, improving safety and helping them focus their time and energy on activities that make better use of their talents.
- Ranked No. 2 on Fortune magazine’s World’s Most Admired Companies list for the seventh year in a row. The annual ranking is determined by a survey of top executives and analysts, and companies are evaluated on factors including the quality of their management and products, commitments to social responsibility, and ability to attract talent.
- Introduced Leadership Liftoff, an onboarding program for operations area managers. New managers enrolled in the program participate in group sessions, on-the-job training, and self-paced learning to help them gain skills and confidence to lead successful teams and foster connections between new leaders.

Supporting communities and protecting the environment Amazon believes that success and scale bring broad responsibility to help the planet, future generations, and local communities in which the company has a significant presence. Amazon employees have passion for investing in these areas, and a sampling of the efforts from this past quarter are that Amazon:

- Activated the company’s global logistics network to support communities impacted by earthquakes in Türkiye and Syria. The company turned its fulfillment center in Istanbul into a Disaster Relief Hub and partnered with local organizations to ship hundreds of thousands of relief items to affected regions. Amazon also made cash donations to non-governmental organizations and set up donation campaigns across 16 Amazon online stores globally to make it easy for customers to support communities impacted by these earthquakes.
- Set a record in 2022 for the most renewable energy purchased by a single company in one year. Amazon’s renewable energy portfolio now includes 164 wind and solar farms and 237 rooftop solar projects in 22 countries, totaling over 20 gigawatts—an amount of energy that could power 5.3 million U.S. homes. Amazon has been the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy for three years running.
- Expanded the use of electric delivery vehicles from Rivian, as part of the company’s commitment to dramatically reduce its carbon emissions. These custom vans from Rivian have now been used to deliver more than 75 million packages in 500 U.S. cities and regions. Amazon began rolling out its electric delivery vans in the summer of 2022 and now has thousands on the road.
- Announced over $22 million in low-rate loans and grants to help build affordable homes in Washington, D.C., and Capitol Heights, Maryland. Since creating the Housing Equity Fund in 2021, Amazon has committed nearly $1.6 billion to help create or preserve affordable homes across Amazon’s hometown communities.
- Announced funding for 8,000 U.S. schools to provide access to computer science education to more than 2 million students by the end of the 2022-2023 academic year through Amazon Future Engineer. By providing professional development for teachers, curriculum development, college scholarships, and internships, Amazon aims to inspire millions of students from underserved and historically underrepresented communities to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).
- Launched the Zero Emission Maritime Buyers Alliance (ZEMBA) in partnership with the Aspen Institute, Patagonia, and Tchibo. ZEMBA will work to reduce the climate impact of maritime shipping by helping to create sustainable economic models in renewable energy, zero-emission fuel production, infrastructure, and clean maritime services.
- Announced that the Right Now Climate Fund is developing the world’s first commercial-scale seaweed farm located between offshore wind turbines in the North Sea to help address climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide as it grows. The Fund is also helping to create and restore ecosystems for plants and animals as part of its commitment to boost biodiversity and currently supports 22 rewilding initiatives in London.

Financial Guidance The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of April 27, 2023, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below.",0.0,"The generated answer is incorrect because it states that stock-based compensation expense accounted for 1.6% of Amazon's common shares outstanding in Q1 2023, while the reference answer states that stock-based awards represented 3.6% of Amazon's common shares outstanding in the same period.","In Q1 2023, stock-based compensation expense accounted for approximately 1.6% of Amazon's common shares outstanding.","AMAZON.COM, INC.

2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain

N/A Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

N/A Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

N/A Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation,

inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic

N/A Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

|Net sales|are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from foreign exchange rates.|
|---|---|
|Operating income|is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 2022.|
|This guidance assumes|among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.|

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on

|Operating income|is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 2022.|

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

5,845 Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a

opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

 100 % Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter

settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

N/A Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

N/A Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain

N/A Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain

N/A Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

5,845 Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

|Operating income|is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 2022.|

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

 100 % Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on

N/A Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify

Excludes the impact of Whole Foods Market. Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on

|Net sales|are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from foreign exchange rates.|
|---|---|
|Operating income|is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 2022.|
|This guidance assumes|among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.|

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

Excludes the impact of Whole Foods Market. Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain

N/A Second Quarter 2023 Guidance
•
Net sales are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared 
with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates. 
•
Operating income is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 
2022.  
•
This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at 
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s 
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic 
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify 
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in 
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on 
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information 
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate 
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain 
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.

|Net sales|are expected to be between $127.0 billion and $133.0 billion, or to grow between 5% and 10% compared with second quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points from foreign exchange rates.|
|---|---|
|Operating income|is expected to be between $2.0 billion and $5.5 billion, compared with $3.3 billion in second quarter 2022.|
|This guidance assumes|among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.|

A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.

Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.
